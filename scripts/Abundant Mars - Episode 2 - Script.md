# Intro  
Good Morning, Good Afternoon, Good Evening, Good Night or Good flight potential Martians.  
  
* I'm Michael Kubler
* The host of this Podcast  
* It's Monday the 27th Feb 2023  
* This is a Podcast about how we can create an **Abundant Centered Society on Mars** and apply the benefits to Earth.  
  
I call it an Abundant Centered Society or ACeS for short  
* You might know it as a Post-Scarcity Society  
* or an RBE - Resource Based Economy.  
  
This is episode **2** and I'll be focusing on the **WHY** of going to Mars and the the **How** of living there.  
  
**In episode one** I focused on **Why** we should be using an **Abundance Centered Society on Mars** instead of Capitalism or an alternative economic system.  
  
I also explained how hard it is to live on Mars.  
  
A quick recap:  
* **It's freezing cold**. Average temp of -60°C (-80° Fahrenheit)  
* The atmosphere is 1/100th the density of Earths and 95% CO2. Thus it's vulnerable to Meteorites  
* It's further from the Sun so only 40% the Solar Radiation of Earth  
* There's no magnetosphere so the Cosmic radiation is **50x more cancerous**  
* Smaller planet so only 38% the Gravity of Earth's. Thus you'll need to exercise a lot if plan on returning.  
* It has Toxic, electrostatically charged (clingy) dust  
* Can only send Space ships every 2.1 years  
* 7 months to get there  
* Would be over 3 year stint to go there and return for a single rotation.  
  
So **it's not easy**.  
However **making life multi-planetary** makes it a worth while challenge.  

Yes, setting up a **base** on the **Moon** or **under the Ocean** would be easier.
However both are still susceptible to most of the issues that could wipe out human life on the surface of the Earth.

We could try setting up on **Venus**. However it's atmosphere is so thick you couldn't really get to the actual ground and you'll have to deal with a floating cloud city like Bespin in Star Wars. Something I don't think we are yet ready for.
  
Once humanity is able to **thrive on another planet**. We, as a species are able to to withstand a whole lot of disaster scenarios that we are currently vulnerable to.  
  
We could be wiped out by a **meteor**, a set of **viruses** or maybe **fungus infection** like in The **Last of Us**. We could be wiped out by a few **super volcanos** or **Nuclear War**.  
Our infrastructure might be wiped out by a **Solar Flare** and we'll be reduced to a life before electricity.  
  
There's also slower burn scenarios like not **transitioning to renewables** fast enough and **running out of Fossil Fuels**.  
Or releasing too many greenhouse gasses and we have **runaway global warming**.  
  
We could have a political or economic collapse.  
For example **Technological Unemployment** from AI causing mass poverty.  
We could fish and pollute too much and have a collapse of the Ocean ecosystem, thus putting too much pressure on our land based food production.  
  
Many of the things we know are coming and we've just not done enough collective action to protect ourselves as under Capitalism we are in a far more reactive than proactive approach. There's plenty of scenarios we are just not at all prepared for.  
  
I can go into plenty more detail regarding a whole lot of these disaster scenarios.  
I'm not the only one who thinks there is reason to worry.  
  
**We recently hit 90s to Midnight on the Doomsday clock.**  
The closest it's ever been to **a potential Apocalypse**.  
Mostly because of things like **Covid**, the **Russian invasion of Ukraine** and some background potential issues even including things like rouge AI.  
  
During the Cold war face off between US and the Soviet Union **the doomsday clock only got to 2 minutes to midnight**.  
Since then it managed to get set back to **17 minutes to midnight in 1991** after the collapse of the Soviet Union and the **signing of START** the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty.  
  
But did you know that **Vladimir Putin just pulled out of the START treaty**?  
  
Did you also know that we are currently nearing the **Solar cycle maximum** and there's a lot greater chance of a Solar Flare or Coronal Mass Ejection from destroying the transformers and power grid of pretty much the entire planet?  
  
We got hit back in **1859** in what was called the **Carrington event**.  
A solar storm powerful enough that telegraph wires sparked and the Aurora, both Northern and Southern lights were visible over nearly the whole planet. As close to the equator as Japan, Mexico and Queensland.  
  
In **2012** we were **missed by 24 days** of the **suns rotation** from another event.  
In **775** it's believed there was a **Solar Flare** that was **10x stronger** than the Carrington Event.  
  
These days such a Solar Flare would **destroy the electricity grid**. The power lines would be carrying voltages way higher than the transformers can normally deal with and would burn out.  
It's very hard to replace the transformers. We don't have many spare. Most countries have only 1 to 10% of the total number currently in use.  
  
Without out an electricity grid I think it would be **a Mad Max scenario** not a Last of Us or I am Legend like scenario.  
  
We'd have 8 Billion people all suddenly finding that there's **a global power outage that just never ends**.  
Within a week the fresh food in the supermarket and people's fridges will have gone off and whilst some areas could have power restored, mostly those close to power plants. We couldn't fix or replace the electrical grid nearly fast enough.  
  
Without power it's really hard to make more transformers or pretty much anything.  
There wouldn't be any power for the petrol stations nor oil refineries. Soon enough all of that would dry up.  
  
Because we currently use about **8kj of fossil fuel energy per kj of food calories consumed** we'd have major issues with growing food.  
Wed have **mass starvation and massive turmoil**.  
My guess is we'd go from 8 Billion to less than 1 Billion people on the planet.  
It would be very nasty and we'd use up all the resources we have remaining on that downward journey.  
Hence more of a Mad Max scenario.  
  
As we've used up the majority of the easily accessible fossil fuels we couldn't easily rebuild.  
**It's hard for people riding horse and cart to man deep sea oil rigs.**  
  
We wouldn't have the energy or remaining infrastructure to fast reboot.  
  
That's just a slice of one of the many different disaster scenarios facing humanity.  
  
So yeah. There's a lot of chances that humanity could be wiped out or wipe itself out.  
  
If we are on two or more planets then there's a greater chance humanity can more than just survive, we can thrive.  
  
  
A disaster scenario where no one directly dies but makes us vulnerable is **Kessler Syndrome**. As shown in the movie **Gravity** with Sandra Bullock.  
  
SpaceX are expected to do 100 launches of the Falcon 9 this year. With a number of new companies also creating orbital launch vehicles.  
  
With the release of thousands of Starlink Satellites and lots of other things being deployed to space there's a lot of things orbiting.  
Depending on the orbital altitude most satellites will be orbiting between **24,000 to 28,000 km/h** (as per [Orbital Speed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_speed)).  
Even up at Geostationary orbits the speed is still around 11,000 km/hr.  
  
We've already had some anti-satellite missile tests which have caused a worrying amount of debris.  
  
At those velocities even flecks of paint can put dents in the International Space Station and something like a screw can rip through it.  
  
This means that if there's a collision or explosion in space, be it accidental or on-purpose.  
We could have a runaway debris scenario.  
  
The debris from one Satellite being destroyed litters an orbital plane and hits more within that plane, both up and especially down. More and more things get ripped apart and soon enough it's too dangerous to send stuff into space anymore because whatever you send is likely to get blown apart and just add to the mess.  
  
In such a scenario it could take tens or hundreds of years before the very light atmospheric drag brings things down and we can access space again.  
  
This is a scenario which could stop us from being able to send rockets out to stop an incoming meteor or simply getting GPS satellites working again. We certainly couldn't be sending people to Mars or the Moon.  
  
However if there was a thriving colony on Mars they could potentially rig up something like a net and probably a whole lot of gel which could try and capture or at least slow down a lot of the debris.  
Because such a scenario is more likely in lower orbit they could place new satellites in Geostationary orbit to keep GPS systems working.  
  
Of course that's a lot softer scenario than an all out nuclear war or giant meteor strike.  
We don't know if there's life in the rest of the Universe.  
So yes. There's lots of reasons to have life be multi-planetary.  
  
I've been focused on humanity, but later in this episode I'll talk about Janes story and how we could be bringing other ecosystems as well.  
  
But first I want to address a common concern.  
  
Some people say we shouldn't spread to other planets **because humans are like a virus.** We are already destroying Earth, we shouldn't be destroying even more planets.  
  
This is epitomised by **Agent Smith** in **The Matrix**.  
However it's not Humanity itself but Capitalism and the need for infinite growth on a finite planet which is causing most of the problems we see.  
  
That's because we incentivise companies to maximise profits. One main way to do that is to ignore the externalities. The damage to Earth's ecosystem is one such externality. Industry pollutes the waterways and air. We throw rubbish on the ground or travel overseas. We have once use items and just throw stuff away. There's planned and perceived obsolescence. Things are being built so they can't be repaired instead of being ready to repair.  
But it wasn't always like that and doesn't need to be.  
  
As an Abundant Centered Society each factory would be filtering the incoming water, making the output cleaner than the input . They'd have roofs which have trees and soil and nature on them and act as safe havens for animals.  
We could have cars which clean the air as they travel and output water.  
We could have bio-nutritional packaging and even clothes which are designed to break down and be good for the soil.  
  
On Mars it would be even more obvious that the more humans that are there the more of Earth's ecosystems we can establish.  
So no. **We aren't a virus.**  
**We can go to Mars and not fuck it up.** If we are using an Abundant Centered Society that is.  
  
Regarding focusing on Earth. I think there's a limited window of opportunity. There's too many looming crises to wait until we enact a transition on Earth. But also there's too much inertia. Too many people with plans to make money and live the life they were promised by society.  
  
But that's not the case on Mars. **It's currently a blank slate**. It's also one with a lot of challenges. 
Needing to rethink society at a fundamental level is expected.
Try explaining to China, or the nations in Africa or the United States that they should transition to an Abundance Centered Society and you'll quickly find that there's the existing culture, politics and the inertia of institutions and people which will actively suppress it happening. 
It would be hard enough trying to get corporate lobbying out of politics, let alone a full rethinking of society. At least, not without a lot of proof it's possible.  
  
Talking about Earth leads me to a point about population.  
There was a famous book which explained the concept of the **Population Bomb**.  
The idea being that because of how many humans there are we will destroy the planet.  
However the formula is generally considered to be  

	Damage = population x resource usage  

We start damaging the planet when we are **using more resources than the carrying capacity of the planet**.

Unfortunately we are well past that point and the more we cut down the forests, pollute the rivers, fish the oceans and generally destroy the environment, **the less the carrying capacity of the planet is**.  
  
However we can make an order of magnitude reduction in how much damage we are doing to the planet. We could even get it that each person is considered a small net benefit.
  
I say this because as the late **Hans Rosling** has pointed out, there will be about **11 Billion people on the planet**.
For most countries they've gone past peak birth rate and their population is declining. If it wasn't for immigration Australia and most other Western nations would be **reducing in population not increasing**.  
  
This is something that few people have truly updated their mental models around.  
Unless there's some major changes then Humanity will naturally fill up the missing gaps in demographics, mostly in Africa and we'll taper off around 11 Billion people.  
  
So **the primary challenge is**  
## **How do we live with 11 Billion people on Earth and do so in a sustainable way?**  
  
To me **an Abundant Centered Society is the answer**.  
  
Especially by focusing on **Closed Loop Material flows, Access Abundance** and a **Systems Perspective**.
  
Check Episode 1 if you aren't sure what those are.  
  
Unfortunately it seems we are reluctant to redesign society on Earth.
My hope is that by developing ACeS on Mars we can create something even better than if we tried doing so on Earth.
We'll also prove it's successful and powerful. So when we then apply it to Earth we'll all flourish.

  
So to recap:  
* By going to Mars we **make life multi-planetary**  
* There's a WHOLE lot of things which **could destroy humanity** or at least send it back to the stone age. From Nukes to Solar Flares, meteors to Viruses and more
* We should be prepared for **11 Billion people on Earth**

Thankfully setting up a thriving society on Mars is a challenge. One that gets people excited.  
  
Can we apply the technology and transition to an ACeS on Earth? **Yes.** 
We'll likely have sound proof doors instead of fully pressurised doors and some other changes to the engineering blueprints but those are relatively easy technical challenges.
The cultural change is currently the harder problem.


--------------------  
  
## What are **the Necessities of Life?**  
  
I would argue that they are things like
1. Oxygen  
2. Water  
3. Food  
5. Shelter  
6. Electricity  
7. Health  
8. Internet  
9. Transport  
10. Education  
11. Entertainment  
  
There's likely others and you might consider something like the Internet not part of a necessity. But this list hopefully makes a good starting point.  
  
I want to explain how we have to re-imagine many aspects of life on Mars because of the environmental challenges.  
  
  
## Oxygen  
  
**Oxygen** can be generated by either mining of ice and electrolysis and probably from artificial and natural photosynthesis of the CO2 from the atmosphere.  
  
This means you'll need some special equipment outside of the habitats to bring Oxygen in.  
  
The main issue once there's enough Oxygen is dealing with the closed loop.  
Obviously we'll be breathing in Oxygen an breathing out CO2.  
So we'll need CO2 scrubbers and plants on the inside. Ones that work in the warmer, pressurised more Oxygen rich atmosphere inside the habitats.  
  
There's[ a combination of 3 main plants](https://www.ted.com/talks/kamal_meattle_how_to_grow_fresh_air?language=en) which can [help with air quality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxR5XHE8aj0&ab_channel=TEDxTalks). The **Areca Palm**, **Mother-in-law's Tongue** and the **Money Plant**. But there's likely other's we'll want to bring.  
We will likely also create ones that are better optimised for low gravity, artificial environments and dealing with the Martian dust.  
  
We'll also need to have Nitrogen gas as part of the air mixture but that's mostly inert.  
  
  
![How to grow fresh air TED talk - Plants to create Oxygen](/scripts/images/Building%20a%20Marsbase%20is%20a%20Horrible%20Idea%20Let’s%20do%20it!.mkv_snapshot_05.02.112%20Settlements%20by%20the%20Martian%20Poles%20for%20water.jpg)  
  
  
## Water  
Water will be another mostly closed loop cycle once we've acquired it.  
We should be able to get **some water from the atmosphere** with some extraction devices, even if it's just equivalent to air-conditioning compressors at the start.  
Even basic systems should be able to bring in more than the day to day water loss from any general leakage.  
But it will be hard to get the  
  
The main source of water is likely to be **the ice caps**.  
Although as I mentioned in the previous episode there's even water in the Opal found not far underneath the surface.  
Extracting, Melting and processing the water will be energy intensive.  
  
Water that goes down the drain needs to be filtered and processed.  
There's no Oceans to pollute. It'll all be inside the base or even inside the Space Ship on the way there.  
  
![Mars Polar Ice Cap](/scripts/images/Mars%20Polar%20Ice%20Cap.jpg)  
  
  
  
## Food  
Those plants you need everywhere. You'll want a bunch of them to be the type that are growing food. Maybe you'll have strawberries in your living room and Lettuce in the canteen.  
Both mostly you'll be needing sections dedicated to an **Aquaponics system**. Especially a tower or wall based system to maximise space usage.  
Ideally it'll also be mostly automated, although being inside makes things easier.  
Given it's on Mars and we'll have airlocks around the place, you'll also be able to precisely control the climate.  
So we can actually **increase the CO2 levels** of the atmosphere in the main food growing compartments.  
  
A constant issue will be needing power to create the artificial sunlight and a good watering system.  
A nice side effect of growing plants is they act as CO2 scrubbers.  
  
An important nutrient cycle will be the toilet. The toilets will need to be the equivalent of a composting toilet. There needs to be systems in place which can process the sewage output and make it biologically safe. You especially want the urea, nitrogen and other nutrients to be used for growing the plants.  
  
This could be done with [bio-reactors](https://youtu.be/ey06E4iEXzg?t=297), mostly just highly oxygenated bacteria which eat the poop, then you can take the sludge out and use it for nutrients whilst getting much cleaner water.  
  
![Building a Marsbase is a Horrible Idea Let’s do it!.mkv_snapshot_05.35.102 - Veggies](/scripts/images/Building%20a%20Marsbase%20is%20a%20Horrible%20Idea%20Let’s%20do%20it!.mkv_snapshot_05.35.102%20-%20Veggies.jpg)  
  
  
## Shelter  
We need Shelter that's **pressurised, safe, able to detect leaks and won't be full of Martian dust**.  
It needs to be heavily radiation shielded as there's a LOT of cosmic radiation on Mars.  
  
It's also freezing cold outside.  
Ohh and because of the thin atmosphere it's way more vulnerable to smaller meteorites.  
  
Most likely you'd want to setup at least partly underground.  
I'd want a **strengthened outer hull** that has both Frozen CO2 and dirt over the top. Both water and CO2 act as great radiation shields, but Water is likely going to be more important for use inside the habitat than outside it.  
  
An **Inner hull** would likely be **coated in aerogel** as a way of reducing the thermal losses.  
The space between the inner and outer hull is where the waste heat and atmosphere would go and hopefully some of that could be recaptured.  
  
Another option is to **build in caves**. But most of the caves on Mars that we know about are lava tubes.  
I'm not sure I'd want to be living where lava flowed without being very very sure it won't flow again.  
Especially as it'll be hard to just run away from.  
**Without a base you die.**  
  
Because we are dealing with pressurised spaces we would need to be building shapes that are rounded and don't have corners.  
You might want **tube shaped areas** for most people to live in.  
  
You might also want some big warehouse sized areas that might be for growing larger food staples, like apples, bananas, wheat, and other grains.  
Eventually you'll even want to create a recreation park.  
  
  
![Building a Marsbase is a Horrible Idea Let’s do it!.mkv_snapshot_03.06.434 - Lack of Magnetosphere and atmosphere](/scripts/images/Building%20a%20Marsbase%20is%20a%20Horrible%20Idea%20Let’s%20do%20it!.mkv_snapshot_03.06.434%20-%20Lack%20of%20Magnetosphere%20and%20atmosphere.jpg)
  
  
![Building a Marsbase is a Horrible Idea Let’s do it!.mkv_snapshot_03.33.333 Frozen CO2](/scripts/images/Building%20a%20Marsbase%20is%20a%20Horrible%20Idea%20Let’s%20do%20it!.mkv_snapshot_03.33.333%20Frozen%20CO2.jpg)
  
  
![Building a Marsbase is a Horrible Idea Let’s do it!.mkv_snapshot_03.52.397 Mounds as a base](/scripts/images/Building%20a%20Marsbase%20is%20a%20Horrible%20Idea%20Let’s%20do%20it!.mkv_snapshot_03.52.397%20Mounds%20as%20a%20base.jpg)
  
## Emergency Equipment  
Each area should have the ability to be sealed. Of course if there's a full depressurisation event in a compartment then people should be able to get to safety.  
  
Of course most areas should have quick access **oxygen masks** and other emergency gear like **Food, water, energy, heating, medical and other supplies**. Ideally even something akin to a **Mars space suit** in order to conduct repairs or leave through depressurised areas.
  
The emergency supplies will be especially important if you get stuck in room for a long time as another area is being repaired.  
Given the potential for random damage caused by meteorites or simply accidental problems it's also a primary reason you would want a bunch of interconnected but separate sections.  
That way you can close off any damaged areas and reduce the damage done to the rest of the habitat.  
  
Fire fighting equipment can include the **shotgun fire extinguisher system**. Basically using pressurised water to blast the fire out.  
Something I mention in Episode 1 is that we might also want the ability to vent the atmosphere if there's a major fire.  
  
## Electricity  
Due to the issues with getting energy on Mars we'll want nuclear power plants and some Solar panel backups.  
  
**Without power** you **can't heat the air**, so you **freeze**.  
  
**Without power** you **can't have the lights on the plants** nor run the **CO2 scrubbers** and eventually **suffocate**.  
  
**Without power** you can't **process the water** and eventually die of **dehydration**.  
  
**Without electricity you die.**  
  
Whilst it's easy to get Energy on Earth, it's a lot harder on Mars.  
  
Ideally we'll be using **nuclear fusion** with the **Helium 3 fusion fuel** coming from mining on the moon or Earth.  
Thankfully the moon bases can be easily solar powered because they'll be much closer to the Sun and also not have to deal with Dust storms.  
Such Nuclear Fusion wouldn't create any radiation. Although there's other types of fusion with different fuels which does create radiation.  
  
Of course we are only just starting to get Fusion energy underway. The longest a nuclear fusion reactor has run for is about **17 minutes**. However there's been **a more than 25 fold improvement** in nuclear fusion from **2018 to 2022**. So it's an area of development that's very promising.  
Although initially we might need Nuclear Fission Reactors, which poses a whole set of problems and my guess is that we'd want Small Modular Reactors (SMR) which is also a somewhat newer technology.  
  
On **Earth** we can pretty easily **power the whole world** with solar and wind. Especially **Concentrating Solar Thermal**.  
  
Ideally you'd have a bunch of CST power towers in the **deserts of the Middle East, Africa and Australia** in order to generate vast amounts of energy.  
  
They work by using a vast array of **mirrors to concentrate the suns energy to a tower**.  
That heats a molten salt to over 550°C and the salt is stored in a thermally insulated tank. When you need power you put the hot salt near water, the water turns to steam and the steam turns turbines.  
You can also do some other things like **decomposing ammonia into Hydrogen**. Or directly electrolysing water for Oxygen and Hydrogen.  
This lets you send the energy to other countries as grid level Hydrogen. If you are dealing with large ships or pipes and large scale hydrogen fuel cells then it's likely a great energy storage medium even if Hydrogen never becomes the primary fuel source for cars.  
  
In regards to size a **100km by 100km** array of Solar PV alone you could be generating enough to power of Australia. That looks like a pretty small square on the map.  
But with large numbers of **Concentrating Solar Thermal plants** in the deserts you could be producing so much energy and  exporting it all over the world that we would consider it virtually limitless.  
We'd become a Type 1 Civilisation on the Kardashev scale.  
  
Given it's mostly just **manufacturing of mirrors** they'd be much easier to maintain over many decades than the harder to manufacture Solar PV Panels which usually only last 20 years.  
There's plenty of Sand, especially in the Deserts. So manufacturing glass isn't an issue.  
If we start having to worry about running out of the silver reflective backing we can easily change to **Aluminium as the reflective surface**.  
So it's easily scalable in a massive way.  
  
From a Monetary perspective if the US Government spent $1 Trillion a year on developing CST instead of the military then even they could be exporting energy to the Middle East instead of fighting over Oil.

On Earth we'd be using Wind, Geothermal and Hydro as well of course.  
But those options just aren't available on Mars.  
  
On Mars we'd want to have a rather decent solar panel array or if it'll work then **CST**. That's especially the case if the aim is to be self-sufficient without any more trips from Earth.
As far as I can tell Iron, Glass and Aluminium should be available in sufficient quantities on Mars.

We'll want some **battery storage** which is fast acting and maybe flywheel or hot rocks energy storage for longer duration energy storage if CST isn't an option.

Mars is hard because energy is what you need a lot of and but gets 40% less solar energy.  


Given the freezing temperatures and constant need for pressurised air, heating, Water and CO2 capture from the environment, lights for the plants, the computer systems and everything else.  
Unlike on Earth I expect **The energy budget of Mars will be tight.** 

Bringing normal uranium nuclear fuel from Earth will be dangerous. Hence **nuclear fusion is preferable**. That way you don't get irradiated if a space ship explodes when leaving Earth or landing on Mars.  
  
There's plenty of problems, but they are all surmountable.

![!THE FIRST 10,000 DAYS ON MARS (Timelapse).mkv_snapshot_13.36.802 Solar Panels base](/scripts/images/!THE%20FIRST%2010%2C000%20DAYS%20ON%20MARS%20(Timelapse).mkv_snapshot_13.36.802%20Solar%20Panels%20base.jpg)
  
  
## Internet  
There's a minimum of a **3min Delay due to light speed** and up to 22mins.  
  
You'd likely have some satellites in orbit acting as communication relays but even then you need to change to non-chatty protocols and a whole different system for transmission. Standard Internet protocols expect to do a handshake and do multiple requests each time they want to transmit.  
  
Getting the latest movies or Facebook feed is going to require some core computer and **network engineering work**. But thankfully we've already got the **IPFS** - inter-planetary file system as a good starting point for across planet transfers.  
You'll want geostationary satellites with big dishes on both planets for high bandwidth comms.  
On Mars you'll need data centre systems which can run fairly autonomously and will be using the local cache.  
  
The big issue is that over the long term, **electrical systems and computing equipment dies** and needs to be replaced.  
  
The hardware and software running anything slightly important needs to be **open source and easily fixed**.  
  
In order to be self-sufficient on Mars we'll need a **general microchip fabrication lab**. Allowing the creation of replacement parts for computer equipment.  
Actually because that Lab could get damaged we'll probably need something which can create microchip fab labs.  
  
Currently microchip fabrication is a pretty big and expensive process that requires special minerals and processes.  
I don't expect we'll be using the latest 3nm techniques, probably creating something more like 30nm at the start.  
  
It's fine that we won't be able to create the latest massive Intel or M1 CPUs.  
The important thing is that without any Microchip fab labs eventually the colony will very likely die out as **without robots we'll have to be doing things manually**.  
But going out with a pick axe to extract chunks of ice from the poles or dig up rocks for extracting Iron Ore is a fast track for **dying of cancer**. Not a good option.  
  
Most likely we'd be using the low power RISC based chipsets for the majority of equipment, especially the the routers and switches and other local network systems and the IoT systems built into everything.

It would also make sense to have a bunch of FPGA computing power. **Field programmable gate arrays** allow you to have **the hardware modify itself** to  create **specialised circuitry**. Allowing hardware optimisations and testing new setups.

This is would be especially useful if you need to do a bunch of special processing, e.g **machine learning one day** then **nuclear physics simulations the next**.

A crucial part is the robots and automated systems for running what would be **the most expensive smart City ever created**.  
  
  
  
## Health  

Health covers both physical and mental health and will of course be an important daily consideration when living on Mars.

If you want to return to Earth then you are going to need to maintain muscle mass. You'll need to **visit the gym daily**.

**Cancer**, be it from the cosmic particles, solar radiation or the toxic dust will be an ever present problem.

We'll need to establish the basics like **blood banks**.
Ideally development of 3D printed replacement organs using your own tissues will be a viable option. Last I saw we could bio-print the basics like a bladder but I'm not sure if that sort of technology will be ready in the next decade to print something like a new liver.

I'm guessing it'll be a long time before we'll be able to **manufacture MRI machines** and other such equipment on Mars. But hopefully we can send enough such specialist equipment to last quite a while. Especially as it should be available **open source** both in **code and blueprints** and designed to be easily fixable.

Mental health might not be quite as bad compared to living on the International Space Station as there will be more people and hopefully [more comedians](https://youtu.be/Lk8KG1T-HZ8?t=548). However being further from home and without a quick re-entry option will probably create an increased sense of dread that needs to be overcome with a good community culture.
Being in a confined space both on the Space ship there and back and in the base wouldn't help. Having screens which show nature or the surrounding environment could help somewhat.

But care for others will be incredibly important.
Having time to talk to others matters a lot.

It could take just one depressed person trying to do a murder suicide to disable safeguards and destroy enough of the base, especially early on, that **it would doom everyone else.**

  
## Transport  
Initially the rockets **aren't likely to have perfect landings on prepared landing pads**, but eventually SpaceX and other companies will get good at landing them.
Or they'll find an alternative solution, like having a large space station like ship which transports people to Mars and then you dock with smaller ships for traversing down to the planet and back.
Eventually in the distant future a Space Elevator could be built.

But for the mean time, it'll be a little hard.
With the reduced atmosphere it's harder to aerobrake and so more of a propulsive landing is required. 
Given the limited window for the best orbital approach, a lot of star ships will be arriving at once or at least there could be hundreds landing over the course of only a couple of weeks.

It's unlikely we'll have much in the way of catching towers on Mars.
For a while it'll be hard to even setup concrete pads to land on. It'll just be on the hard ground.

You'll probably have to be in a space suit and travel in the equivalent of a bus on Mars, or Martian buggy if the Space Ship landed somewhere hard to get to.

The rockets will likely need to be moved from their individual landing sites towards refuelling stations.
This means some machines to tow / move the rockets.
You don't want them landing too close to the methanol processing plants, nuclear reactors nor the main base. The nuclear fuel carrying ones should also land somewhat further away, just in case. But also not so far away we can't get to them.

We'll also want medical and fire teams available on the ground. Just in case.

Transport within the city will likely need to support both an automated **electric tram** like system as well as **pedestrian and bike lanes**. Or if it's relatively small distances an **omnivator system**. 
Elevators able to go anywhere. 

Very long distances would be better via **a Maglev train**.
Even the normal Mars atmosphere would be nearly equivalent to an evacuated tube on Earth, so you probably don't need to put it in an evacuated tube, but you would want it in a tube to **protect against dust and meteorites**.

Given a main Martian base might be somewhat **by the equator** of the planet but the ice, that is, the water sources would be at the poles then **long range transport** might be important for getting water.

You'll also want to transport **mined minerals from** other mining bases.
  
## Education  
Mostly VR and online Education would be expected. But because we'll want people to know many of the systems, they'll need to learn how to run a lot of things. 
Similar to how some mines on Earth and military expect anyone to be able to drive a truck or use the fire fighting equipment, have basic medical first aid, and the like.
But that'll extend to oxygen and pressure equipment, airlocks, remote controlled Robots and other systems.

I go into more detail about this in Janes Story which is coming up.
  
## Entertainment  
There's screen time and play time.  
You can only watch a screen for so long.  
Having novel experiences can be important for humans and VR can help.
But having areas to run or eventually a recreation park, maybe a pool for swimming, grass to run on, trees to climb. Places to walk and meet people. These things will make a big quality of life difference.  
  
I wonder if **a water fountain** looks much different when there's only 37.5% gravity?
  
--------------------------------------------  
  
# Who is Going to Mars?  
  
Unlike what I've seen some people suggest **I really don't think many billionaires would want to go to Mars**. 
Not until a colony was rather well established.

The first people going would need to have the right stuff to survive and help the colony thrive.
Eventually becoming it's own self sustaining civilization.

## Being selected to go to Mars  
Because of the rigors of going to Mars and especially living there, the extreme cost and the need for a whole new way of thinking, we can't just let anyone go.
  
Basically you need to be mentally and physically fit and healthy. Ideally you'd also have some useful skills.

You also want to filter out the crazies and people who might end up killing everyone else.

This means no sociopaths and no psychotics.

### No Sociopaths  
We [don't want Sociopaths](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/35492496-taming-toxic-people) and certainly not [Psychopaths](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpWJGAMKkBc&ab_channel=WorkplaceWellnessFestival). People who manipulate others for their own personal gain and especially who lack empathy. They usually **kiss up and kick down**.
These are people who will **kill without remorse**. They are **usually the bad guys in nearly every movie**.

Identifying such people means doing at least 3 types of tests. 
1. A **Psych questionnaire** - There's [some questionnaires which can help identify sociopaths](https://www.ted.com/talks/jon_ronson_strange_answers_to_the_psychopath_test).  
2. The '**waiter**' test. See how the people interact with others of a lower rank or status than them. For example if you are at a restaurant then are they shitty to the waiters? If you are at work, don't ask the Boss, ask people who serve under them.  
3. **Brain scans.** It seems that [a PET scan](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/the-neuroscientist-who-discovered-he-was-a-psychopath-180947814/) can [fairly obviously identify sociopaths](https://www.ted.com/talks/jim_fallon_exploring_the_mind_of_a_killer).  
  
### No Psychotics  
Both Psychopaths and Psychotics are generally damaging to the greater whole. **Psychotic people are those who don't have a proper grasp on reality**.  
People who are particularly paranoid, delusional or overly conspiratorial.  

As an example you can determine people who are particularly conspiratorial with just 3 questions.

This is from the **You are Not so Smart Podcast** Ep #**197** on **Conspiratorial Thinking**.
About **22mins into the episode**.  
  
> https://pca.st/episode/9e04c644-174d-41f0-a14a-0739e2ec511b?t=1323  
>  
>  
> Answer from **0** (not at all agree) to **7** (very much agree) on the next statements:
>  
> 1. **Much of our lives are being controlled by plots hatched in Secret Places**  
> 2. **Even though we live in a Democracy a few people always run things anyway**  
> 3. **The people who really run the country are not known to the voters.**  
>  
> Joseph Uscinski says most people who might believe in 1 rarely believe in the others and so most people rate somewhere in the middle.  
> It's the worrying conspiracy theory people who rate all 3 highly.
  
  

The aim is to be filtering out people with obvious problems in order to increase the chances of success of the colony.
However **even if you do filter out all Psychopaths and Psychotics**, people can become **psychotic** over time. For example having a bump to their head, develop brain lesions or chemical imbalances.
Also kids can develop into psychopaths, especially if they've experienced extreme trauma.

So the initial filtering doesn't mean you don't have to deal with these problems eventually, just hopefully not early on when things are the most fragile.  
  
### Once you've been selected to go to Mars  
  
If you know you are going to be going to Mars then a few things.  
  
* **Start going to the Gym**. During your trip there you'll need to be doing 2 hours of exercise a day with resistance training machines. You can't just run or so some sit-ups. You'll need to be using exercise machines to keep you from losing your muscle and bone mass. Both whilst on the voyage there and on Mars. This will be especially important if you want to return to Earth. Unfortunately, especially for people like me open running isn't going to cut it. **Get used to using machines**.
* You might want a **subscription to Brilliant** or to start using **Khan Academy** so you can brush up on your Maths. Play Kerbal Space program and learn about Orbital mechanics. or how solar cells work or about the chemical process involved in Photosynthesis. Or how to grow plants, or build computer systems. The idea is that you should try to **understand the systems that support you**.  
* There's likely a **3-12 month intense training course**. Some of this might be done in Antarctica to help get people used to being in such an extreme climate and with relative isolation and grouped together into small groups of people.
  

## Going to Mars  
So **pooping in Zero G** is a whole issue that's not fully been resolved by the sounds of it.
Most of the time the toilet has a flow of air and slight suction in an attempt to keep the faecal matter going where it should. But it sounds like it's not a very good system.
I have a thought about how maybe 6 Starships could be tethered together and spin during the journey to provide some artificial gravity. I wouldn't need to be a lot, assuming the toilet is near the outer wall.
Some gravity would also help reduce the amount of daily exercise needed. 
The other main option is a whole lot of adult diapers. 

Energy will be a big issue. It's a long trip.
You can't just use batteries when it's 7-8 months.

Having the Starships unfold a bunch of solar panel arrays would provide a power source along the way.
If you've got a tether then it can also be used for power distribution amongst those connected.

A small nuclear reactor is another option. But has some potential downsides.
We'll also need WAY more power than an RTG or **Radioisotope thermoelectric generator** is capable of outputting. Most would barely be able to power the lights and fans for the toilet. Let alone the water filtration system.

The **water and Oxygen processing systems** on the Space Ships will have to be pretty impressive. Low energy, high reliability and not too heavy or too large.

-------------------------------  

I've been talking for ages now. But I think it's time to put some of the information into context.
  
# Jane in Capitalism:  
  
"**Ahh damn it, the battery has died on this one too**" Jane complained.  
"*Careful about your swear words, the company monitors these comms*" said Ben.  
"**What, even out here?**" Jane said as she groaned.  
"*Just install a new battery*" replied Ben, ignoring her.  
"**I've already replaced 3 of them, this run, I have to go back to base and get more**" She said.  
"*Then I'll leave some batteries waiting for you here by the entrance*" he said over the comms.  
  
Jane was out in the repairs tractor again.  
She'd come to Mars to work on the Moxie system. The Mars Oxygen ISRU Equipment.  
  
The MOXIE towers produce oxygen from carbon dioxide in the Martian atmosphere by using solid oxide electrolysis.
The towers needed regular cleaning and sometimes new solid oxide electrolysers. They need the CO2-rich Martian air to be pressurised and heated to 800°C then passed through a solid oxide electrolyzer (SOXE) assembly where CO2 is electrochemically broken down into oxygen ions and carbon monoxide (CO).
The towers were placed in a large grid with electricity to each of them.
Each tower is about 1 tonne and requires 25kw of electricity in order to create 2 to 3kg of O2 an hour.  
The Oxygen is used for a lot of things. 
Obviously humans breathing. But also each return trip requires some 30 tonnes of O2 Rocket fuel. There's also the Iron smelting and creation of steel which uses both Arc and Oxygen furnaces. Even the sewage treatment plant uses Oxygen. 
  
The repair tractor Jane is in, is just a heavily radiation shielded buggy with a basic storage compartment for spares and repairs.
Whilst the Moxies themselves are serviced by robots, those robots have a habit of breaking down.
Currently it seems there's a bad batch of batteries which break in the ultra cold temperatures on Mars.  

Jane is out trying to repair the various robots.  
  
Like most things on Mars, it's not a fun job.  
Eventually Jane will be able to take over Ben's position of running the systems back at base and someone will replace her.
  
Jane isn't even a robotics expert. She was sent over because she was good with Chemistry and had some experience with the Moxie project and isn't married.

Her company basically forced her to go over, saying they'd sue her for a breach of employment contract. 
After her 4.4 years or 2 rotation on Mars are up she is looking forward to getting back to Earth. It's shitty pay considering the working conditions.

Jane briefly used a VR system on the 7 month journey over, in order to learn more specifics of her Job. But it was mostly a boring investor presentation about how the Moxie towers work on Mars and then some very crude buttons to turn the Moxie system off and on. Everything else was listed as proprietary tech. 
The same went for other parts of the simulation. There was so many competing systems and proprietary company technology that you couldn't really do anything.
This meant she had a rude awakening when she got to Mars to find out her main job was to go fix robots.  
It took a lot of training by Ben to explain the process. Although he was glad to not be the one going on missions anymore.
  
# Jane in ACeS  
  
Jane's mind just had a eureka moment! **What about a rainforest?**  
  
Jane has been working in the Aquaponics system for the last few months. She'd initially joined in order to work on the Moxie system. But whilst on the space flight over she was immersed in the VR simulation of the Mars digital twin.  
It was updated regularly from both Mars and with ideas from Earth.  
There was about 12 ships with 80 people each all able to interact on the one local simulation. Usually 700 people would be on at once and the team going over got to understand the Mars base well.  
The open source nature of everything meant it was a high fidelity simulation. There was IoT sensors and a delayed but continuous stream of information about the actual base available. With the ability to setup scenarios, like what happens if you turn the Moxie system off or the Nuclear reactors have issues.
  
Whilst they'd done some general training on Earth, Jane managed to learn about various systems whilst on the trip over and soon learned that the Moxie system they were using was fine.
  
Under ACeS they had changed to using a Plasma Reactor design instead of the Solid Oxide Electrolyzer technology.
Because of the high CO2 concentration but low density of air the Plasma Reactor design meant they  basically just needed to shoot an electron beam down a tube. No heating and pressurising the air.
Instead of separate towers the Moxies were built into the sides of the Mars base. They weren't far away and needed far less maintenance.
On top of that someone had developed an automated Robot tow truck.

If a robot was having issues then the tow truck would get it, bring it back to the mechanics dock in the base where it could be fixed pretty easily. Even the diagnostics and basic repairs were surprisingly automated.

This was possible because there was work done during the design and development phase allowing for quick diagnostics and a focus on repairability.  
They also used a different battery system. Instead of Lithium Ion, they used a liquid battery. It was a red liquid which had been designed to work in the extreme cold of Mars. Although it didn't like it much below -110ºC, so some heating elements were needed.
A large battery tank robot would usually hang around where needed and robots would come recharge themselves with new juice as needed. 

The used up liquid was recharged at couple of places in the base which would recharge large pools of it when the power grid had some spare capacity.

In the mechanics dock, if a robot had broken down irreparably, usually because of a meteorite strike, then it would be disassembled and the main 3D printed metal hull would be sent to the metal forge to be melted down into new feedstock for the metal 3D printers.

Some clever engineers had setup some railguns to protect against meteor impacts so even those are very rare, at least within the protection range.

Jane knew there was 3 fast aiming railgun sites which could work in-conjunction with both ground and satellite based radar to track and destroy or at least break apart any meteorites large enough to be a danger.

With all that setup, Jane wasn't really needed in her initial job. It was good to have someone skilled in the chemistry as a backup.
But there was someone already keeping an eye on the MOXIE equipment and developing newer and better systems.
So in the VR game she started to try various other tasks.
After analysing the O2 closed loop needs she soon realised that there was enough humans on the base  breathing that CO2 scrubbing was becoming far more important than creating new O2.
  
Because the air is already pressurised and warmed inside the habitats the Plasma Moxie systems aren't an option.
The older style solid oxide electrolyzers currently work, but they need to heat the air up so hot that it then needs to be cooled down and heating and cooling is a large energy cost.

You can use some of the heat from the metal smelting but can't use the air from those system as it's dangerous, so you have a mass of heat pumps to a CO2 scrubbing room next to the smelter. But then you are still pulling heat from the arc furnaces, making it work harder.

What Jane realised when looking at the whole thing from a systems perspective was that the Aquaponics system was actually doing half the work of the CO2 scrubbing and produced food at the same time.
Whilst they needed a bit of light and water, it was way more efficient.
  
Jane had been a bit of a green thumb back on Earth. She'd mostly been growing Roses and things, so had to do some learning around tomatoes, lettuce, and other greens.
  
The Aquaponics system was a pretty great system.  
They had the nutrient water sprayed directly onto the plants roots. This was like a human taking multivitamins and water. 
However the main food source of the plants was the carbon in the air. Converting water and CO2 into carbohydrates and releasing the unneeded for them O2.
So CO2 and water was actually the primary feedstock.
  
There was artificial lighting and the aquaponics rooms had a higher CO2 concentration of 450ppm for most crops.
  
There was multiple layers of crops in each room and they were starting to grow cereal crops like Corn, sugar cane and soybean. With Canola and sunflower for vegetable oils.
Although the crops did need a lot of space.

The water systems had fish in them which helped produce more nutrients and when they died the fish were often a great meal.

Some of the nutrients from the food would be used by people but most would flow through the sewage system back.
  
The sewage treatment plant would use bacteria to eat the faeces. The water was highly aerated to help them grow super fast. Then the bacteria would form a sludge at the bottom which would be further processed and then used as the primary nutrient feedstock to the Aquaponics system.  
  
It was a great closed loop system.  
  
But Jane had realised it wasn't enough.  
A great opportunity existed to build a rain forest on Mars! 

Whilst a Rainforest dome would be a somewhat resource intensive project and the biggest pressurised and heated dome on Mars so far. She knew it would soon enough be a far less energy intensive form of CO2 scrubbing and it would be a great place to enjoy nature in.

She knew that there was already a seed bank in a barely pressurised, freezing cold storage bunker.  
There was some experiments with using the sewage sludge mixed with cleaned Martian sand to make soil. There had been a couple of bags of soil brought along from Earth as part of the experiment for reference. It took some effort but thanks to some ingenuity it was now possible to clean the toxins from the Martian dirt.
They had soil, bacteria and nutrients. There was even some worms in the bags of soil !

It would take a while to make more soil. But they only needed a tiny bit to start with as they germinated the bush and tree seeds.  
  
They'll need a big custom dome. 
It'll be hard to use completely artificial lighting on, but there was an option of simply using a layer of water on the outside to stop the radiation whilst allowing sunlight to pass through, reducing the artificial lighting needs.

They usually used Frozen CO2 and then a layer of dirt because the CO2 was decent enough for stopping the solar rays and was plenty abundant. 
There was also the dirt protecting against meteorites. 
But with the railguns stopping major impacts and enough plastic and glass and with hex shaped segments to stop it all being damaged at once those weren't really issues anymore.
Hopefully she could convince people that a clear dome like this would be worth using up that much water. 
Ohh, it would be a lot of water. Both on the outside and inside. They'll need water in the soil and to create a small running river.
  
But it's a once off cost and they had some excess water as it was.

Jane got stuck into it.  
A week later she had an initial plan that she proposed.
There was a bunch of technical details to further work out, but there was a lot of people who were getting Earth sick and the tiny patch of fake grass in the small courtyard wasn't enough to feel like they were reconnecting with nature.
  
A team of people got stuck into it.
Jane got the seeds out and started germinating them ASAP.
An engineering design of the dome was created. It would be the largest volume pressurised building in the Mars base complex. Tall enough and big enough for enough trees to grow that you would be able to stand in the centre and not be able to see the sides of the building. At least when the trees would be fully grown.

They got a few % of the smelter outputs for the Steel and Glass over the next 9 months in order to construct the main dome.
In the end the biggest limiting factor ended up being the transparent Aerogel. There was plenty of translucent or opaque aerogel which was used on all habitats inner hulls to dramatically reduce heat loss. It's an amazing material and was being used in a form optimised for thermal isolation.
But at the start they had to put the translucent murky stuff on the outside and wait for the next shipment from Earth to replace it with the transparent stuff.
Eventually they'll make aerogel on Mars.
  
The next set of ships also brought insects, birds and other animals. They'd setup an ecosystem.
It took some work to find out what a viable rainforest ecosystem would be.

Mosquitos weren't allowed. They are the the leading killer of humans given they cause blood to blood transmissions between people and with it lots of diseases, including Malaria.
Whilst some genetically engineered mosquitos could be used, people vetoed any of those suggestions.
When it was all worked out they realised at flies would have still have to be a part of the ecosytem. The spiders, frogs and even ants still needed them.

There was a continuously running river planned. It would weave it's way from one side and down to the other. Then a set of underground pipes would bring the water back up the hill.

Because you didn't want to kill off the tadpoles in the water using spinning turbines, the pipes used a special rolling wave design which worked like intestines, squeezing the water all the way up. Although a very long corkscrew design was the backup plan if that failed.

There would be a triple door, double airlock system for humans getting in and out. Mostly as a quarantine step, to blast the insects off you.

There was already laser systems in some hallways designed to kill any mosquitos which might have been able to make their way onto Mars and all ships had cockroach and rat traps plus poison baits and monitoring systems.
But now they need to add detection systems to make sure you weren't letting birds or lizards out of the enclosure where they could nest in weird spots and cause havoc.
  
It took a few years to get enough soil and water and then to wait for the plants to grow to an acceptable height.
They ended up genetically engineering some of the primary trees to grow faster and even had a section specifically designed for chopping down and using on the base as needed.
  
But the Rainforest dome was considered one of the best places to visit when you were missing Earth. There was a picnic area in the centre which Jane would visit.

More and more domes were now being built with clear roofs. There was a push to setup a Zoo on Mars, in the case of a catastrophe on Earth we'd be able to repopulate various areas if needed.
There was new anti-cancer treatment and prevention and so the long term viability of people living on Mars and dying of old age had increased dramatically.
  
Jane was happy to live here on Mars, especially after meeting Hank, the love of her life. A fellow green thumb and nature lover.
  
# Comparison between Capitalism and ACeS  
  
In the Capitalism version there was so much pressure on getting work done that it is hard for people on the ground to innovate. 
Multiple other companies all used robots to do tasks. 
For example search for and Mining Iron ore and Ice. For building the buildings, for transporting to/from the Space ships.
But they all used their own tech and considered most of it proprietary.
Even if there was some attempt at integration there was so many different systems it was hard to connect them all together.
Under ACeS everything was Open Source, open and transparent. A single standard was developed and whilst the Robots had different functions they were all considered as a collective system.
Jane could see all the information from the Nuclear Fusion power plant to the IoT oxygen sensors in the Iron and glass furnaces. 
Being an Abundant Centered Society she was also encouraged to take things from a Systems perspective.  

Capitalism Jane couldn't move positions very easily. She could've suggested a Rainforest and the higher ups would have just laughed at her. That's not what the company was contracted for. But she wasn't even able to suggest it because she didn't have the requisite information.
There was also conflict between the different companies, all trying to get more. This meant there was no one developing the railgun system or actively sharing their current progress on removing the toxins from the Mars dirt.

## VR Game
The VR experience in ACeS was a lot more vibrant because that's an important part of the immersion in the new social and economic system. Trying to teach collaboration. Trying to remove some of the bad habits and thinking processes from living in a monetary society.

I do think we should create a computer game experience of Mars with both a Capitalism and ACeS version and compare how people have experiences in both. These stories are just my imagination.

But a game would allow us to do refinements of the Abundant Centered Society in a virtual space, allowing for rapid iteration.
It's something we could be building now, before anyone sets foot on Mars.
In my mind it would be something along the lines of Satisfactory meets the detail of Star Citizen and physics of Kerbal Space Program. A First Person creative game, that's also an MMO.
Except for it to be a game it needs to have action loops and be gamified. To be useful as a tool for learning about an ACeS society it would likely be more like a documentary than a movie. Or more specifically more like a slightly laborious Sims game than a First Person Shooter or RTS.
Then again, most games have a lot of grind to them. If the grind was used for good, like helping program how things work together and people worked in teams, then it could be an interesting experience.  
Jane McGonigal has some great points in her book **Reality Is Broken: Why Games Make Us Better** and also **Imaginable: How to See the Future Coming and Feel Ready for Anything―Even Things That Seem Impossible Today**  
Plus **Super Better**. Which all indicate this would be a worthy project.  
You'd of course have both an Earth and Mars setup.
